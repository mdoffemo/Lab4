# Introduction to Software Programming: Lab4

This project is made in the context of the course "Introduction of Software Programming" at the Institute for Geoinformatics in MÃ¼nster. It includes classes for a rectangle, circle and point, and a superclass Shape. The classes Rectangle, Circle and Shape all inherit some functions from the superclass and have some functions of their own i.e. setting and getting the parameters, calculating the area, perimeter, distance,... In addition, there is a file with unit tests that makes sure everything works properly.
